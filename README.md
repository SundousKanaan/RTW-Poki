```
nvm install 19.8.1
```

### Clone repo
2. Clone this repository by running:
```
git clone https://github.com/SundousKanaan/RTW-Groep.git
```

### NPM install
3. Install the dependencies by running:
```
npm install 
```

### Start server 
Run the following code to start the server: 
```
node app.js
```

## 💾 Used Technologies 
* EJS templating engine
* Express
* Socket.io
* [Gfycat’s API](https://developers.gfycat.com/api/#updating-gfycats) 🔗

---

## Process
### Getting started with socket.io
<details>

1. The first goal is to set up a simple HTML webpage that serves out a form and a list of messages. We’re going to use the Node.JS web framework express to this end. Make sure Node.JS is installed.

```
npm install express@4
```

2. Once it's installed we can create an index.js file that will set up our application.
```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const http = require('http');
const server = http.createServer(app);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('<h1>Hello world</h1>');
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('listening on *:3000');
});
```

3. Integrate socket.io 
```
npm install socket.io
```

4. That will install the module and add the dependency to package.json. Now let’s edit index.js to add it:
```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const http = require('http');
const server = http.createServer(app);
const { Server } = require("socket.io");
const io = new Server(server);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html');
});

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('a user connected');
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('listening on *:3000');
});
```

5. Add a script tag in your index.ejs file for.
```html
<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
```

7. To see connections and disconnections add this code to your server.js
```js 
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('a user connected');
  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
    console.log('user disconnected');
  });
});

```

## Process

I started thinking about my concept that I would build and I had 3 ideas:

- Use a free Pokemon API to build the game "Who is this Pokemon?"
- Use a free Harry Potter series API to build a game of guessing the name of the spell by its caption.
- A room to watch videos collectively and chat together
- 
### Choosing idea

The stream room was the most exciting for me, because I watch anime with my friends at the same time, but not collectively in one place, and we have to make a note that we started the episode to start almost together, and this is sometimes bad because we miss direct interactive chat while watching.

### Sketching
<details>

I drew the main pages and the link between them in a simple way, and how it will look between the admin and the regular member

<img src="./readme-images/Sketching1.png" alt="Sketching">
<img src="./readme-images/Sketching2.png" alt="Sketching">

- **App notes**
  * Room state check
  * Admin view is with stream controles
  * Chat users view without stream controles
  * send gif's 
  * mobile view is column but big screens row

</details>

### API's

**API's Features**

<details>

1. YouTube Iframe API
   - Making a special frame for the player through the id of the YouTube link
   - Start the player via a separate button using "play Video() & stopVideo()"

  It also provides data about the video, such as the title of the video and others, but what matters to me is the id of the video.

2. Gfycat API
   - Search in a few different languages
   - jive address
   - GIF image in several different qualities
   Classification of carrion
   - And other data related to carrion
   I used the highest quality gif available and also the gif title

</details>

## Data modeling

<img src="./readme-images/Data-Lifecycle-Diagram.png" alt="Data Lifecycle Diagram">

My data lifecycle diagram contains the events that occur during the use of the application and the types of exchanges that occur between users, the server and the associated API's.

### Real time events


<details>

`Connection`
<details>

- Event is executed when the user connects to the server.

- When the user connects to the server, the connection event is triggered. The server sends a message to the client confirming that the user is successfully connected to the server.

```JavaScript
//server.js
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
    console.log('a user connected');
    socket.emit('connection', 'You are connected to the server');

    // Meerder socket events
    socket.on('disconnect', () => {
        console.log('user disconnected');
    });
});
```
</details>

`New room`
<details>

- Event is executed when the check room button is pressed.

- When checking that the room name is not in the server's memory, the name is added to the memory and the room is opened.

```JavaScript
// server.js
  socket.on('checkRoom', (roomname) => {
    console.log("openRoomName", roomname);

    let roomIndex = roomUsers.findIndex(room => room.ID === roomname);

    for (const [index, room] of Object.entries(roomUsers)) {
      if (room.ID === roomname) {
        roomIndex = index;
        break;
      }
    }
```
</details>

`username check`
<details>

- Event is executed when the user is filling in their username
  
- It is checked directly whether the username is reserved for another person in the room or not, so that the user gets a direct feedback

```js
// server.js
  socket.on('nameCheck', (data) => {
    console.log("nameCheck:", data);
    const client = data.clientName
    const roomId = data.roomID;

    const roomData = roomUsers.find(room => room.ID === roomId);
    if (roomData) {
      const currentRoomUsers = roomData.users
      // console.log("roomData.users",room_users);
      //   console.log("roomData",roomData);
      socket.emit('nameCheck', { client, roomId, currentRoomUsers });
    } else {
      socket.emit('nameCheck', { client, roomId });
      console.log('ID niet gevonden in de array');
    }
  })
```
</details>


⚠️`Room admin`
⚠️ A special event to determine the chat admin
<details>

- The event is executed when a new member joins the room and in the offline state.

1. Verification is done when joining the room because the first person to join (in the matrix of room members) is the admin responsible for controlling the video
2. Verification is done in the absence of communication in order to become the next member of the matrix in the admin (since the main admin is considered to have left the chat)
   
```js 
// server.js
  socket.on('roomAdmin', (data) => {
    console.log("roomAdmin", data.roomID);

    const room = roomUsers.find(room => room.ID === data.roomID);
    if (room) {
      // console.log("86 LOL", room); // Geeft een array terug met de gebruikers van de kamer
      io.emit('roomAdmin', {data,room})
    } else {
      console.log("Kamer niet gevonden");
    }

  })

// scriptroom.js
function roomAdmin(roomUsers) {
  const room = roomUsers.find(room => room.ID === roomID);

  const currentAdmin = room.users[0];
  h1.textContent = `Admin ${currentAdmin}`;
  socket.emit("roomAdmin", { currentAdmin, roomID });
}

socket.on("roomAdmin", (roomData) => {
  console.log("roomData", roomData);
  const room = messages.getAttribute("data-room");

  if (roomData.data.roomID === room) {
    if (roomData.room.users[0] === usernameInput.value) {
      videoForm.classList.add("admin");
      // span.classList.add("admin");
    }
  }
})
```
</details>


`join Room`
<details>

- Event is executed when it is verified that the user name does not exist in the room, so that it goes directly to the band, and the user is added to the room data inside the server

```js
// server.js
 socket.on('joinRoom', (data) => {
    socket.join(data.room);
    socket.room = data.room;

    // Save username and room for offline event
    clientRoom = data.room;
    client = data.user;

    const Room = data.room;
    const roomUser = data.user;

    let roomIndex = roomUsers.findIndex(room => room.ID === Room);

    if (roomIndex !== -1) {
      // Add the new user to the users array in the found object
      if (!roomUsers[roomIndex].users.includes(roomUser)) {
        roomUsers[roomIndex].users.push(roomUser);
      }
    }
    else {
      // If the room ID was not found, add a new object to the array
      roomUsers.push({ ID: Room, users: [roomUser] });
    }

    io.emit('joinRoom', { Room, roomUser, roomUsers });

    socket.emit('chatHistory', roomHistory);
    console.log("rooms DATA:", roomUsers);
  });

```
</details>

`chat message`
<details>

- The event is executed when a message is sent from the chat via the send message button
- The room data, the text of the message, the time of sending, the user name and the user picture are transferred to the server to be transmitted to all members of the chat.
  
```js
// server.js
  socket.on("chatmessage", (chat) => {
    const room = chat.room;
    const message = chat.message;
    const username = chat.username;
    const avatar = chat.avatar
    const time = chat.time
    console.log("chat message |", time);

    // send the message to all sockets in the room
    io.emit("chatmessage", { username, message, room, avatar, time });
  });

```
</details>

`Chat History`
<details>

- The event is executed when a message or GIF is sent from the chat via the Send Messages button
  
- The presence of the room name is checked in chat history or not. If it is found, the message data will be added to the room data, and if it is not, a new element will be created containing the name of the new room and its data
  
```js
// server.js
  socket.on("chatmessage", (chat) => {
    const room = chat.room;
    const message = chat.message;
    const username = chat.username;
    const avatar = chat.avatar
    const time = chat.time
    console.log("chat message |", time);

    // send the message to all sockets in the room
    io.emit("chatmessage", { username, message, room, avatar, time });


    // Zoek de index van de kamer in de roomHistory array
    const roomIndex = roomHistory.findIndex((item) => item.roomID === room);

    if (roomIndex !== -1) {
      // Kamer bestaat al, voeg het bericht toe aan de bestaande kamer
      roomHistory[roomIndex].messages.push({ username, message, avatar, time });
    } else {
      // Kamer bestaat nog niet, voeg een nieuw kamerobject toe aan roomHistory
      roomHistory.push({
        roomID: room,
        messages: [{ username, message, avatar, time }],
      });
    }

    // Optioneel: beperk de grootte van de geschiedenis per kamer
    const roomMessages = roomHistory.find((item) => item.roomID === room).messages;
    if (roomMessages.length > historySize) {
      roomMessages.shift(); // Verwijder het oudste bericht
    }
    console.log("roomHistory:", roomHistory);
  });
```
</details>

`chat GIF message`
<details>

- The event is executed when a gif message is sent from the chat via the send gif button.
  
- The addition to the chat history is also made

```js 
// server.js
  socket.on('gifmessage', (message) => {
    console.log("Hi:", message)

    const room = message.room;
    const gifMessage = message.gifUrl;
    const searchKey = message.searchKey;
    const userName = message.userName;
    const avatar = message.avatar;
    const time = message.time;
    const gifName = message.gifName;

    io.emit("gifmessage", { gifMessage, room, userName, avatar, time, gifName });

    // Zoek de index van de kamer in de roomHistory array
    const roomIndex = roomHistory.findIndex((item) => item.roomID === room);

    if (roomIndex !== -1) {
      // Kamer bestaat al, voeg het bericht toe aan de bestaande kamer
      roomHistory[roomIndex].messages.push({ userName, gifMessage, avatar, time, gifName });
    } else {
      // Kamer bestaat nog niet, voeg een nieuw kamerobject toe aan roomHistory
      roomHistory.push({
        roomID: room,
        messages: [{ userName, gifMessage, avatar, time, gifName }],
      });
    }

    // Optioneel: beperk de grootte van de geschiedenis per kamer
    const roomMessages = roomHistory.find((item) => item.roomID === room).messages;
    if (roomMessages.length > historySize) {
      roomMessages.shift(); // Verwijder het oudste bericht
    }
    console.log("roomHistory:", roomHistory);
  });
```
</details>

```js
// server.js
  socket.on('streamLink', (data) => {
    const link = data.link;
    const roomID = data.roomID;
    console.log("link", data);
    socket.broadcast.emit('streamLink', { link, roomID });
  })
```
</details>
